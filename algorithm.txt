1. design html (do elements with id)
2. get ids on javascript
3. get the input value and store in a variable
4. create a function that returns the converted units in both metric and imperial
inside the function:
5. Create formulae that would compute the lenght, volume and mass in both system and store these respectively in a variable.
6. user innerHTML to display the new computed values
7. addEventListener to the convert button which would invoke the function
